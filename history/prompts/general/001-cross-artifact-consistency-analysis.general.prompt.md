# Cross-artifact Consistency Analysis

## User Input
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Analysis Summary

Performed a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md.

### Critical Findings:
- spec.md is completely empty with only template placeholders
- constitution.md is a template with no actual project principles
- Tasks reference wrong spec path (`/specs/1-generate-textbook/spec.md` vs actual `/specs/001-generate-textbook/spec.md`)
- Plan claims to pass constitution gates that don't exist

### Other Issues:
- Performance requirements lack environmental conditions
- Dependencies refer to user stories that don't exist in spec

## Detailed Report

[Detailed analysis report as generated by the assistant]

## Recommendations

1. Complete spec.md with actual requirements and user stories
2. Complete constitution.md with actual project principles
3. Validate plan and tasks against completed spec
4. Do not proceed with implementation until these critical issues are resolved
